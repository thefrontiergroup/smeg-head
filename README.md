# Smeg Head

Smeg Head is a simple git hosting application built with Ruby on Rails. It is currently under heavy development.

*Please Note:* Smeg Head is currently at very, very early stages. Honestly, there is nothing to see here.

## Getting Started

To get started, it should be as simple as running:

    git clone git://github.com/thefrontiergroup/smeg-head.git
    cd smeg-head
    ./script/configure
    ./script/server
    
This will:

* Clone the repository
* Change into it
* Setup bundler if missing
* Run bundle install
* Copy example configs and open them in your `EDITOR` of choice.
* Run rake db:setup
* Start up a web server with the application open.

Leaving you with a useable blank slate.
